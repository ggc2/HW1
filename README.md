### Weaknesses 
The major weakness in the company is the commisions business model. An article by PYMTNS stated, "That played into criticism by Chanos, who started with Coinbase’s “really excessive commissions” of 2.5% to 2.6% and added that if retail customers “do four trades a year, it’s 10%. That’s a big hit”([PYMNTS](https://www.pymnts.com/cryptocurrency/2022/coinbase-feels-heat-as-business-model-cracks-under-strain/)). As a retail investor, which makes the majority of users, making money can be complicated and with such high commissions, users may opt out of investing in the long run. 
Another major weakness is that the crypto indudstry is not yet back up by the government ([coinbase](https://help.coinbase.com/en/coinbase/other-topics/legal-policies/how-is-coinbase-insured)). Not being FDIC-insured is a major concern and a big decision factor for new user to adap to the cryptoeconomy. 
### Advantages 
Coinbase main advantage comes from them bieng the first in platform to open up the cryptoeconomy to the retail investor. Even though, main competitors are now in the business, there is no current competitor has a solution for the high fee's associated with cryptos. Beign the first one also allowed Coinbase to placed themselves as the largest US-Based cryptocurrency exchange. 
In addition, the first-mover advantage gave Coinbase the prestige of being the most knowledge and the company that attracts the best of the best. Nerdwallet, rated Coinbase 3.5/5 when it comes to fee structure; however, no competitor, has a better rating ([NerdWallet](https://www.nerdwallet.com/reviews/investing/brokers/coinbase)).
Coinbase advantages include its trading platform, its Learn to Earn program and their ability for quick withdrawals.

## Recommendations 
Cryptocurrencies are here for the long run and they will not go away. My recommnedation leans towards the adaptation and acceptance of crypto in the next 5-10 years. According to Faust Principe, security is in the top concerns for cryptocurrencies. In his article, he wrote "Security is also a concern because cryptocurrencies are vulnerable to cyber-attacks. Governance is another issue because no central authority oversees cryptocurrency transactions" ([Principe](https://geekyfaust.info/editorial/what-are-the-biggest-problems-in-cryptocurrency/)). In other words, in order to reach maximum users, Coinbase has to become the safest cryptocurrency platform. Consumers will eat the high fees, if the safety is guaranteed. 

Offerring full transperancy on 'safety matters' builds up trust in users. Coinbase should take an initiative and invest money in a safety board that does not work directly for Coinbase, but instead, its main function will be to serve the entire cryptoworld. Coinbase's Blog provides information on different cyber attacks and that happen through the entire ecosystem, here is an example, [Celer Bridge incident analysis](https://www.coinbase.com/blog/celer-bridge-incident-analysis), even though the attack did not impacted Coinbase directly, it impacted the crypto ecosystem creating panic and fear. Therefore, creating a safety net for the entire ecosystem will guarantee user's safety and will give Coinbase all the credit for it, building on the prestige to keep them as the "*Numero 1*" online platform for the cryptoeconomy
